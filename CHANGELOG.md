All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Default Custom Labels**: "Previd√™ncia" (retirement funds) and "Seguran√ßa" (safety reserve) custom labels are now automatically created when initializing a new database, ensuring all users start with these essential categories available
- **Edit Existing Positions**: "Atualizar Posi√ß√µes" tab now supports editing positions on the same date to fix incorrect values. New "‚úèÔ∏è Editar na mesma data" checkbox allows users to choose between editing existing data or creating a new snapshot
- **Inline Editing for Invested Values**: Dashboard "Detalhes por Ativo" tab now allows inline editing of "Investido" (invested_value) column. Click any cell to correct wrong values, and "Ganho" (gain/loss) automatically recalculates. Changes are saved with a single button click
- **Update Positions Feature**: New "Atualizar Posi√ß√µes" tab in the upload component that allows users to:
  - Load positions from a previous date as a starting point
  - Edit individual position values
  - Remove positions that were sold
  - Add new positions that were acquired
  - View real-time summary of changes (total positions, total value, percentage change)
  - Preserve custom labels and classifications when updating
  - Handle duplicate date detection with options to delete or merge
- Session state management for tracking original values to prevent UI updates from affecting displayed original values
- **Asset-Level Rebalancing Details**: Granular breakdown in Dashboard "Rebalanceamento" tab showing:
  - Individual assets within each category with current values and percentages
  - Specific investment recommendations for each asset when categories are underweight
  - Multiple allocation strategies:
    - **Proportional distribution**: Maintains current asset weights within category
    - **Equal distribution**: Spreads investment equally across all assets in category
    - **Manual selection**: Guidance for custom allocation decisions
  - Smart selling recommendations only when no new investment is provided
  - Warning messages encouraging adding new money instead of selling positions
  - Automatic expansion of categories requiring significant action (>R$ 100 adjustment)
  - Clear visual status indicators (‚úÖ balanced, üî¥ underweight, ‚ö†Ô∏è overweight)

### Changed
- **Dashboard Filtering**: Labels with 0% target allocation are now excluded from "Vis√£o Geral" and "Rebalanceamento" tabs, but all assets remain visible in "Detalhes por Ativo" tab. This allows users to have custom labels (like Previd√™ncia and Seguran√ßa) that don't participate in active portfolio management but can still be tracked
- **Detalhes por Ativo UI**: Filters are now hidden in a collapsible expander (collapsed by default) to reduce visual clutter. Sort dropdown remains visible for easy access
- Upload component now has three tabs: "Entrada Manual", "Upload XLSX", and "Atualizar Posi√ß√µes"
- Dashboard "Rebalanceamento" tab now includes detailed asset-level breakdown below category-level analysis
- Rebalancing UI now emphasizes adding new money over selling existing positions

### Technical Details
- Added `_initialize_default_labels()` method in Database class (database/db.py:110-142)
- Default labels are inserted only if they don't already exist (idempotent operation)
- Labels created with 0% target allocation and no reserve amount (can be customized later)
- Updated dashboard filtering logic to exclude labels with `target_percentage == 0` (components/dashboard.py:24)
- Rebalancing analysis now excludes 0% targets from target_allocations dictionary (components/dashboard.py:183)
- "Detalhes por Ativo" tab now receives `all_positions` to show complete portfolio (components/dashboard.py:94)
- Filters in "Detalhes por Ativo" wrapped in `st.expander()` for cleaner UI (components/dashboard.py:429)
- Added `edit_same_date` session state variable to track edit mode (components/upload.py:213)
- Same-date editing automatically deletes old positions before saving edited ones (components/upload.py:395)
- Dynamic button labels based on edit mode: "Salvar Altera√ß√µes" for same date, "Salvar Posi√ß√µes Atualizadas" for new date
- Added `update_position_invested_value(position_id, invested_value)` method in Database class (database/db.py:241-252)
- Replaced `st.dataframe` with `st.data_editor` in asset details for inline editing (components/dashboard.py:516-522)
- Only "Investido (R$)" column is editable; all other columns are read-only for data safety
- Change detection compares original vs edited DataFrame to show save button only when needed
- Ganho columns automatically recalculate based on formula: `value - invested_value`
- Added `_render_update_positions()` function to handle the update workflow (components/upload.py:193)
- Added `_save_updated_positions()` helper function for batch saving (components/upload.py:393)
- Added `_clear_editing_state()` helper function for session state cleanup (components/upload.py:411)
- Session state variables added: `editing_positions`, `base_date`, `new_date`, `positions_to_remove`, `new_positions`, `original_values`
- Added `_render_asset_level_rebalancing()` function to display detailed asset recommendations (components/dashboard.py:267)
- Asset recommendations sorted by priority: categories needing action first, then by adjustment amount
- Conditional display logic: selling recommendations only shown when `additional_investment == 0`
