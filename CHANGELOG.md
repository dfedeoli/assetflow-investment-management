  - Simple input to set minimum reserve amount (R$), completely independent from percentage-based targets
  - Automatic calculation of available funds: Current Seguran√ßa value - Reserve amount = Available to invest

  - Smart status indicators in Carteira de Investimento Rebalanceamento tab:
    - ‚úÖ Green success message when Seguran√ßa is above minimum (shows excess available)
    - ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning when Seguran√ßa is below minimum (shows deficit, sets available to R$ 0)

- **Edit Existing Positions**: "Atualizar Posi√ß√µes" tab now supports editing positions on the same date to fix incorrect values. New "‚úèÔ∏è Editar na mesma data" checkbox allows users to choose between editing existing data or creating a new snapshot

    - **Manual selection**: Guidance for custom allocation decisions
  - Smart selling recommendations only when no new investment is provided
  - Warning messages encouraging adding new money instead of selling positions

### Changed
- **Visualization Improvements**: Replaced bar charts with interactive Plotly donut charts in "Vis√£o Geral" tabs. Donut charts better represent portfolio proportions for rebalancing decisions. Features include:
  - Interactive hover tooltips showing values and percentages
  - Total portfolio value displayed in the center of the donut
  - Clear visual representation of allocation distribution
  - Applied to both Carteira de Investimento and Previd√™ncia components
- **Carteira de Investimento Filtering**: Labels with 0% target allocation are now excluded from "Vis√£o Geral" and "Rebalanceamento" tabs, but all assets remain visible in "Detalhes por Ativo" tab. This allows users to have custom labels (like Previd√™ncia and Seguran√ßa) that don't participate in active portfolio management but can still be tracked
- **Detalhes por Ativo UI**: Filters are now hidden in a collapsible expander (collapsed by default) to reduce visual clutter. Sort dropdown remains visible for easy access
- Upload component now has three tabs: "Entrada Manual", "Upload XLSX", and "Atualizar Posi√ß√µes"
- Carteira de Investimento "Rebalanceamento" tab now includes detailed asset-level breakdown below category-level analysis
