## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Emergency Reserve Management for Seguran√ßa**: Set a fixed minimum reserve amount for the "Seguran√ßa" category. The system automatically calculates excess funds available for rebalancing:
  - Dedicated "üîí Reserva de Emerg√™ncia" section in "Classifica√ß√£o de Ativos" tab (separate from target allocations)
  - Simple input to set minimum reserve amount (R$), completely independent from percentage-based targets
  - Automatic calculation of available funds: Current Seguran√ßa value - Reserve amount = Available to invest
  - Pre-filled default value in "Valor adicional a investir" input based on calculated excess (uses session_state for proper updates)
  - Smart status indicators in Dashboard Rebalanceamento tab:
    - ‚úÖ Green success message when Seguran√ßa is above minimum (shows excess available)
    - ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning when Seguran√ßa is below minimum (shows deficit, sets available to R$ 0)
    - ‚ÑπÔ∏è Info message when exactly at reserve amount
  - Seguran√ßa completely excluded from target allocation form and validation (not part of 100% calculation)
  - Seguran√ßa used ONLY to calculate excess funds for default "Novo Investimento" value
  - Seguran√ßa does NOT appear in "Aloca√ß√£o Atual vs Meta" table or rebalancing suggestions
  - Seguran√ßa does NOT appear in Dashboard overview (reserve-only mode, completely separate from portfolio analysis)
- **Default Custom Labels**: "Previd√™ncia" (retirement funds) and "Seguran√ßa" (safety reserve) custom labels are now automatically created when initializing a new database, ensuring all users start with these essential categories available
- **Edit Existing Positions**: "Atualizar Posi√ß√µes" tab now supports editing positions on the same date to fix incorrect values. New "‚úèÔ∏è Editar na mesma data" checkbox allows users to choose between editing existing data or creating a new snapshot
- **Inline Editing for Invested Values**: Dashboard "Detalhes por Ativo" tab now allows inline editing of "Investido" (invested_value) column. Click any cell to correct wrong values, and "Ganho" (gain/loss) automatically recalculates. Changes are saved with a single button click
- **Update Positions Feature**: New "Atualizar Posi√ß√µes" tab in the upload component that allows users to:
  - Load positions from a previous date as a starting point
  - Edit individual position values
  - Remove positions that were sold
  - Add new positions that were acquired
  - View real-time summary of changes (total positions, total value, percentage change)
  - Preserve custom labels and classifications when updating
  - Handle duplicate date detection with options to delete or merge
- Session state management for tracking original values to prevent UI updates from affecting displayed original values
- **Asset-Level Rebalancing Details**: Granular breakdown in Dashboard "Rebalanceamento" tab showing:
  - Individual assets within each category with current values and percentages
  - Specific investment recommendations for each asset when categories are underweight
  - Multiple allocation strategies:
    - **Proportional distribution**: Maintains current asset weights within category
    - **Equal distribution**: Spreads investment equally across all assets in category
    - **Manual selection**: Guidance for custom allocation decisions
  - Smart selling recommendations only when no new investment is provided
  - Warning messages encouraging adding new money instead of selling positions
  - Automatic expansion of categories requiring significant action (>R$ 100 adjustment)
  - Clear visual status indicators (‚úÖ balanced, üî¥ underweight, ‚ö†Ô∏è overweight)

### Changed
- **Visualization Improvements**: Replaced bar charts with interactive Plotly donut charts in "Vis√£o Geral" tabs. Donut charts better represent portfolio proportions for rebalancing decisions. Features include:
  - Interactive hover tooltips showing values and percentages
  - Total portfolio value displayed in the center of the donut
  - Clear visual representation of allocation distribution
  - Applied to both Dashboard and Previd√™ncia components
- **Dashboard Filtering**: Labels with 0% target allocation are now excluded from "Vis√£o Geral" and "Rebalanceamento" tabs, but all assets remain visible in "Detalhes por Ativo" tab. This allows users to have custom labels (like Previd√™ncia and Seguran√ßa) that don't participate in active portfolio management but can still be tracked
- **Detalhes por Ativo UI**: Filters are now hidden in a collapsible expander (collapsed by default) to reduce visual clutter. Sort dropdown remains visible for easy access
- Upload component now has three tabs: "Entrada Manual", "Upload XLSX", and "Atualizar Posi√ß√µes"
- Dashboard "Rebalanceamento" tab now includes detailed asset-level breakdown below category-level analysis
- Rebalancing UI now emphasizes adding new money over selling existing positions

### Technical Details
- **Emergency Reserve Implementation**:
  - Separate "Reserva de Emerg√™ncia" section created before target allocations (components/classification.py:168-201)
  - Independent form for reserve amount with its own submit button (components/classification.py:178-194)
  - Reserve saved with 0% target to exclude from dashboard analysis (components/classification.py:192)
  - Seguran√ßa filtered from `all_labels` list using list comprehension (components/classification.py:219)
  - Seguran√ßa excluded from existing_targets display (components/classification.py:275-291)
  - Target percentage validation no longer includes Seguran√ßa (not part of 100% sum)
  - Position filtering includes labels with `reserve_amount > 0` even if target is 0% (components/dashboard.py:26-29)
  - This ensures Seguran√ßa positions are included in calculations despite having 0% target
  - Dashboard calculates available funds: `excess = current_seguranca - reserve_amount` (components/dashboard.py:231)
  - Three info states tracked: 'excess' (above reserve), 'below' (deficit), 'exact' (at reserve) (components/dashboard.py:233-252)
  - Default investment calculated and stored in `st.session_state.seguranca_excess` (components/dashboard.py:254-262)
  - Session state ensures input value updates when reserve changes (components/dashboard.py:296)
  - Status messages display before "Novo Investimento" section with appropriate styling (components/dashboard.py:265-284)
  - Seguran√ßa filtered from target_allocations when reserve_amount is set (components/dashboard.py:208-218)
  - Seguran√ßa excluded from comparison table display - only status message shown (components/dashboard.py:319-322)
  - Rebalancing plan calculations don't include Seguran√ßa at all (uses filtered target_allocations)
  - Existing `target_allocations.reserve_amount` column in database used (database/db.py:65, database/models.py:60)
- Added `plotly` dependency (version 6.3.1) for interactive visualizations
- Replaced `st.bar_chart` with `plotly.graph_objects.Pie` (hole=0.45) for donut charts
- Donut charts implemented in Dashboard (components/dashboard.py:129-155) and Previd√™ncia (components/previdencia.py:91-117)
- Chart configuration: 45% hole size, outside label positioning, interactive hover templates, center annotations showing total value
- Added `_initialize_default_labels()` method in Database class (database/db.py:110-142)
- Default labels are inserted only if they don't already exist (idempotent operation)
- Labels created with 0% target allocation and no reserve amount (can be customized later)
- Updated dashboard filtering logic to exclude labels with `target_percentage == 0` (components/dashboard.py:24)
- Rebalancing analysis now excludes 0% targets from target_allocations dictionary (components/dashboard.py:183)
- "Detalhes por Ativo" tab now receives `all_positions` to show complete portfolio (components/dashboard.py:94)
- Filters in "Detalhes por Ativo" wrapped in `st.expander()` for cleaner UI (components/dashboard.py:429)
- Added `edit_same_date` session state variable to track edit mode (components/upload.py:213)
- Same-date editing automatically deletes old positions before saving edited ones (components/upload.py:395)
- Dynamic button labels based on edit mode: "Salvar Altera√ß√µes" for same date, "Salvar Posi√ß√µes Atualizadas" for new date
- Added `update_position_invested_value(position_id, invested_value)` method in Database class (database/db.py:241-252)
- Replaced `st.dataframe` with `st.data_editor` in asset details for inline editing (components/dashboard.py:516-522)
- Only "Investido (R$)" column is editable; all other columns are read-only for data safety
- Change detection compares original vs edited DataFrame to show save button only when needed
- Ganho columns automatically recalculate based on formula: `value - invested_value`
- Added `_render_update_positions()` function to handle the update workflow (components/upload.py:193)
- Added `_save_updated_positions()` helper function for batch saving (components/upload.py:393)
- Added `_clear_editing_state()` helper function for session state cleanup (components/upload.py:411)
- Session state variables added: `editing_positions`, `base_date`, `new_date`, `positions_to_remove`, `new_positions`, `original_values`
- Added `_render_asset_level_rebalancing()` function to display detailed asset recommendations (components/dashboard.py:267)
- Asset recommendations sorted by priority: categories needing action first, then by adjustment amount
- Conditional display logic: selling recommendations only shown when `additional_investment == 0`
